# Audio-Reactive LED Research

Research into making LEDs respond to musical *feeling*, not just volume. Explores what audio features actually matter when humans react to music, and how to map those features to LED behavior in real-time.

Includes beat detection algorithms, a WLED Sound Reactive comparison framework, an audio annotation toolkit, and findings from studying why existing approaches don't feel right.

**Status**: Work in progress. This repo will be cleaned up and properly documented for public consumption. Until then, expect rough edges and reorganization.
