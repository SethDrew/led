# Physical Sculpture Notes

## Wood Prep

**Pipeline:** Remove bark → bake → dry → sand → seal → route → LED → epoxy fill

Pretty repeatable once dialed in.

### Drying / Bug Treatment

Oven at 170-200°F works fine with a slow ramp. Above 250°F gets risky for fresh/green wood.

**Alternatives if oven runs too hot:**

| Method | Temp | Duration | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| Black plastic bag in sun | 140-160°F | 1-2 days | Solar kiln, works in Oakland summer |
| Borax soak | Ambient | — | No heat needed, very effective |
| Freezing | 0°F or below | 72+ hours | Zero cracking risk, needs chest freezer |

## Diffuser Options

| Option | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Thickened epoxy (fumed silica + mica) | ~$14 | Epoxy is the expensive part (~$10-12 resin per piece). Silica and mica are cheap per use. |
| UV gel resin | ~$18-25 | 2-3x cost of standard epoxy by volume. Needs UV flashlight (~$15 one-time). |
| Silicone caulk | ~$3-5 | A $7 tube of GE Silicone II covers multiple pieces. Least attractive but most economical. |
| Silicone diffuser tubing (friction-fit) | ~$5-8 | ~$1-3/m silicone LED channel. No mixing, no curing. Very repeatable. |
| Clear heat shrink over strip into channel | ~$2-3 | Minimal diffusion but protects strip, slightly frosted look. |

### Cost Estimates Per Sculpture

| Height | LED Strip | Diffuser | Total |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1m | $18 | $14 | $32 |
| 2m | $36 | $25 | $61 |
| 3m | $54 | $35 | $89 |

## Non-Embedded LED Attachment

For surfaces where routing a channel isn't possible or desired.

### Adhesive

- **Silicone LED mounting adhesive** (Loctite Clear Silicone or specialty LED silicone) — flexible, waterproof, nearly invisible on natural wood. Run a bead along the back/underside of the strip and press into natural grooves.
- **VHB (Very High Bond) tape** — 3M VHB is what commercial LED installations use. Extremely strong, clean look, no visible fasteners. Most strips come with 3M backing, but adding VHB to irregular surfaces works better.

### Mechanical (Clean)

- **Copper or brass micro-staples** — tiny staples that look intentional and decorative against natural wood. Available in finishes that complement the aesthetic.
- **Thin copper wire wraps** — solid-core copper wire wrapped around the wood at intervals. Reads as intentional design rather than fastening. Oxidizes nicely over time.
- **Leather or waxed cord lashing** — deliberate lashing at regular intervals with quality cord. Reads as craftsmanship rather than improvisation. Fits rustic/organic aesthetic.

## Too-Thin Wood

Cut half the branch off longways, adhesive the strip in, clamp a mold around it, and pour diffuser to "complete" the other half of the branch with diffuser + strip.
